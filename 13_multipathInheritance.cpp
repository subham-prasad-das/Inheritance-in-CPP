/*
    -> The form of inheritance which derives a new class by multiple inheritance of base classes, which are derived earlier from the same base class, is known as multipath inheritance.
    -> It involves more than one form of inheritance, namely multilevel, multiple and hierarchical inheritances at one go.

    -> For example, 
        - let there be one "super class".
        - we then inherited two more classes from that super class, which fulfil the example of "Hierarchical Inherirtance", namely "Middle classes".
        - After that, we made another class which is the derivation of those two middle classes, fulfilling the example of "Multiple Inheritance", namely "Child Class".
        - Also, we know that, the "Child class" is ultimetely derived from "middle class", which is also derived from the "Super class". So it also fulfill the example of "Multilevel Inheritance".
